<H2> DMR-001 Overview: "Ambush Predator" </H2>  
<H3> Delivery Vector  </H3>
This malware was distributed using a Watering Hole Attack (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/">MITRE T1189</a>) against a common resume-collection application. 
The  application is an HR tool which queries a resume-scraping service in order to automatially aggregate a pool of qualified candidates. The service then fetches the candidate's resume, cover letter, etc. and uploads them in the form of a .zip archive to the application.

&nbsp;

The application then opens the .zip archives and parses the content on the client-side. The Threat Actor uploaded a malicious .zip archive with a .scr payload inside disguised as a PDF file with the aim of it being detonated on a company machine.
