<H2> DMR-001 Overview: "Ambush Predator" </H2>  
<H3> Delivery Vector  </H3>
This malware was distributed using a Watering Hole Attack ([MITRE T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/)) against a common Resume-Collection application. 
The application is an HR tool which queries a resume-scraping service in order to automatially aggregate a pool of qualified candidates from online sources. The service fetches the candidate's resume, cover letter, etc. and uploads them in the form of a .zip archive to the application.

&nbsp;

This application then opens the .zip archives and parses the content on the client-side. The Threat Actor uploaded a malicious payload to one of these resume sites in hopes that this tool would automatically fetch it and deliver it to a company machine.
