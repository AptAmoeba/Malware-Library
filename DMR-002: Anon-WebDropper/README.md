<H2> DMR-002 Overview: "Anon-WebDropper" </H2>  
<H3> Delivery Vector  </H3>
This malware was distributed via an email as an attachment claiming to be a voicemail. The vector wasn't really impressive, but the dropper was neat!

&nbsp;

The "voicemail" file (HTML file with integrated JavaScript) opens and attempts a connection to a webserver, encrypting the data that it sends. It includes the email used during the delivery phase as an identifier and automatic filter so the server can categorize the request.
At the time of investigation, the C2 server is active, but denies the request when supplied with our particular identifier.
