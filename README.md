# Malware-Library
Malware samples I have found &amp; investigated in the wild; not pulled from other sources. (Most of these come from intercepted corporate phishing campaigns that I found interesting.) 

My own writeups are available for each of these, but I encourage you to investigate each sample yourself first. 

&nbsp;

<ins>If I missed something in my writeups:</ins>

Please open an Issue, insult me, and then show me your interesting findings - I enjoy learning new things.

## Library Format
- Each Sample will have a designated folder, denoted by a cool name I choose representing each campaign.
- The master folder will contain the following:
  -   My writeup
  -   A tl;dr synopsis (Delivery vector, objective, MalwareBazaar link, notes, etc.)
  -   A YARA rule for detection
  -   An archive file containing the payload/live malicious binary.
- The live-payload archive will be denoted "[Month/Year] - [SHA 256 Hash]"
  - Industry-standard archive password: "infected"
  - Any content within this zip archive will be presented as it was originally received. Original filenames, hashes, etc. are preserved.
